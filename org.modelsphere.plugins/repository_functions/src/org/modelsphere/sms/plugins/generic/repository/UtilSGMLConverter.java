/**
     Returns a converted string according SGML rules.
     <br>
     Target System : <b>All</b><br>
     Type : <b>User Function</b><br>
     Parameters : a string to be converted.<br>
     Note : This function converts a ASCII text into a SGML text by replacing each
     '<' character by the metacharacter '&amp;lt;', each '>' character by the
     metacharacter '&amp;gt;' and each '&' character by the metacharacter '&amp;amp;'.
     Converts also French diacritical characters into valid SGML tags.
     Suitable when you have to generate a text (such as a Java method's body or
     a view's selection rule containing '<', '>' or '&' characters into a
     HTML or XML format.<br>
