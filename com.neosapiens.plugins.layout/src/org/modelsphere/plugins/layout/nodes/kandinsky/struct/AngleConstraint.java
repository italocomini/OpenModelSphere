 * De�?nition 4.11 Let G = (V, E, F ) be a plane graph. An angle-constraint
 * is a tuple (I, v, a, c). The �?rst entry I is a list of darts, which is an interval
 * inside E(v) for v ∈ V . The entry a is an integer with 0 ≤ a ≤ 4 denoting the
 * target-value for the sum of the angles de�?ned by the darts in the interval,
 * and the last entry c is a non-negative integer, denoting a cost-factor for
 * derivations of the target-value of the angle.
